#jovo-hasura

[Jovo](https://www.jovo.tech/get-started) is the first open source framework for developers to build cross-platform voice apps for Amazon Alexa and Google Home.

This is a starter project for deploying your Jovo project with SSL certificates. It comes with basic hello-world app generated by Jovo.

## Deployment guide

1. Get this project.

```
$ hasura quickstart roarman/jovo-hasura
```


2. Deploy with just three commands. Run these commands from the root directory.

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "First commit"
$ git push hasura master
```

Done! Your hello-world Jovo webhook is running at `https://jovo.<cluster-name>.hasura-app.io/webhook`. Run `hasura cluster status` to get the cluster-name.

## Modifying the webhook code

The source code for this webhook lives at `microservices/jovo/app`. You can modify it however you wish. To get started with developing cross platform voice apps with Jovo, check out their [awesome docs](https://www.jovo.tech/framework/docs/).

## Migrating your existing project.

1. Replace the contents of `microservices/jovo/app` with your source code.

2. Make sure your code starts at `index.js`. (If not, change `index.js` to whatever it is in `microservices/jovo/Dockerfile`).

3. Deploy.

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Migrated jovo project to Hasura"
$ git push hasura master
```
